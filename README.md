3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :
(a) Provided summary statistics for age, weight, and salary.
(b) Analyzed average age, weight, and salary by player position.

5. Top Players :
(a) Identified the top 10 players with the highest salaries.

6. College Analysis :
(a) Determined the top 5 colleges producing the most NBA players.

7. Position Distribution :
