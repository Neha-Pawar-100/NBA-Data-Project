   This project analyzes NBA players data to uncover insights into player demographics, salary distributions, and team compositions. Key steps and findings include:

   DATA LOADINNG & CLEANING :

* Loaded NBA player data into a Pandas DataFrame.
* Handled missing values and removed duplicate entries.

* Added a 'BMI' column using the formula: BMI = (weight in pounds / (height in inches)^2) * 703 with a fixed height of 70 inches.

EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) :

* Provided summary statistics for age, weight, and salary.
* Analyzed average age, weight, and salary by player position.

DATA VISUALIZATION :

* Created a Histogram plot to show the distribution of NBA players' ages.
